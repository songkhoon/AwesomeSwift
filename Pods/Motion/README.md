## Welcome to Motion

Motion is a tool used to create transition animations between view controllers. 

## Sample

Take a look at a sample [Photo Collection](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Samples/tree/master/Projects/Programmatic/PhotoCollection) project.

## Changelog

Motion is a growing project and will encounter changes throughout its development. It is recommended that the [Changelog](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion/wiki/Changelog) be reviewed prior to updating versions.

## Motion Animations

You can add animations to any UIView or CALayer using the *motion* API with an optional completion block. For example, to change the background color of a view with a 45 degree rotation:

```swift
view.motion([.backgroundColor(.blue), .rotationAngle(45)]) {
    // Do something when complete.
}
``` 

### Available Motion Animation Values

- spinX
- spinY
- spinZ
- scale
- scaleX
- scaleY
- scaleZ
- translate
- translateX
- translateY
- translateZ
- x
- y
- point
- position
- fade
- zPosition
- width
- height
- size
- shadowPath
- shadowOffset
- shadowOpacity
- shadowRadius
- depth

## Motion Transitions

Motion allows for view controllers to animate between each other. By adding a value to a view's *motionIdentifier* property, a view will animate to the look of another view. For example, animating a floating button to a bar:

![Motion Button To Bar](http://www.cosmicmind.com/motion/cosmicmind_motion_button_to_bar.gif)

### From View Controller

```swift
button.motionIdentifier = "options"
```

### To View Controller

```swift
bar.motionIdentifier = "options"
```

That's it. By setting the *motionIdentifier* property, Motion animates one view to another within different view controllers.

## Motion Transition Animations

View animations may be added to views that are transitioning using the *motionAnimations* property.

```swift
bar.motionAnimations = [.delay(0.35), .duration(3)]
```

## Enabling Motion Transitions

To turn on Motion transitions between view controllers, set the *isMotionEnabled* property to `true` within the view controllers that transition between each other, and any container controllers, such as `UINavigationController`.

## Motion Delegate

Use the *MotionDelegate* to tap into key parts of a transition between view controllers. The available delegation methods are: 

```swift
func motion(motion: Motion, willTransition fromView: UIView, toView: UIView)
    
func motion(motion: Motion, didTransition fromView: UIView, toView: UIView)
    
func motionDelayTransitionByTimeInterval(motion: Motion) -> TimeInterval
```
